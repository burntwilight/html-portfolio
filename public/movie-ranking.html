<h1>The Best Movies According to Dakota</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bokeh</h3>
<p>Gorgeous film set in Iceland about a couple who wake up to a world void of anyone but themselves. 
    This film touches on a key concept of the need for community and people outside ourselves.
    On top of everything else mentioned, the film's score is unlike anything I have heard; it perfectly sets the melancholy feel of the movie.

<h3>Columbus</h3>
<p>This movie is truly amazing.
    This movie depicts what I describe as the feeling of "midwest emo" music: a feeling of youth, love, melancholy, loneliness, and longing.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>One of my favorite anime films. The soundtrack is unlike anything else.</p>
